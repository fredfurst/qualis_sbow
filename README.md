# Qualis SBOW (Selenium Bag of Words)

This is a tool I cooked up in a couple of late nights, after iteration for a particular finality: putting together a simple list shown in a table with the Sucupira Qualis Qualification score for a given qualification event, and for a given Journal name.

## Motivation

The repetitive nature of the commands required, and the potential for automation was enough to prompt experimentation. As soon as the initial code started properly working, I knew I had something worth sharing.

### How to Install

Clone the repo, run the Python script, using python qualis_sbow_wc.py with a Selenium driver available as well as libraries.
